/// A trait for accessing data from a generic Polygon.
///
/// A `Polygon`â€™s outer boundary (_exterior ring_) is represented by a
/// [`LineString`][LineStringTrait]. It may contain zero or more holes (_interior rings_), also
/// represented by `LineString`s.
///
/// # Semantics
///
/// The _boundary_ of the polygon is the union of the boundaries of the exterior and interiors.
/// The interior is all the points inside the polygon (not on the boundary).
///
/// The `Polygon` structure guarantees that all exterior and interior rings will
/// be _closed_, such that the first and last coordinate of each ring has
/// the same value.
///
/// # Validity
///
/// - The exterior and interior rings must be valid `LinearRing`s (see [`LineStringTrait`]).
///
/// - No two rings in the boundary may cross, and may intersect at a `Point` only as a tangent.
///   In other words, the rings must be distinct, and for every pair of common points in two
///   of the rings, there must be a neighborhood (a topological open set) around one that
///   does not contain the other point.
///
/// - The closure of the interior of the `Polygon` must equal the `Polygon` itself.
///   For instance, the exterior may not contain a spike.
///
/// - The interior of the polygon must be a connected point-set. That is, any two distinct
///   points in the interior must admit a curve between these two that lies in the interior.
